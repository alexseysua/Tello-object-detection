# 👩‍💻📸 Object detection using YOLOv8

For my Bachelor Semester Project 2, I chose to focus on object detection, by leveraging on YOLOv8, 
a popular framework for object detection, object classification and more, developed by [Ultralytics](https://github.com/ultralytics).

GitHub repository for YOLOv8 : (https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)

The project is divised into two parts:
* Object detection Python application
* Implementation on a robot using [ROS](https://www.ros.org/)
